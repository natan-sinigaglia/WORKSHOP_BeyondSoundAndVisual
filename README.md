# BeyondSoundAndVisual
Node20 workshop

## Workshop Description
Whether we come from music or the visual arts, the moment we decide to explore other forms of expression, trying to extend our practice, comes with a sense of void. 
It is the moment in which we leave the familiar harbor and sail towards an undefined and vast space of potential. 
If we manage to embrace the uncertainty of this condition and listen carefully, new forms and meanings arise from the threshold between the languages, 
redefining and merging them into something that is more than just the sum of the two (visual and sound): it is a new form of expression, a new nature, with autonomous behaviours and states. 
Thanks to the visual programming language vvvv the exploration can be immediately smooth and playful, allowing us to follow the ephemeral moment of intuition and walk a creative path through uncertainty and grace.
